# wildlive_remote
WildLive remote is an open source project to turn a raspberry pi into a remote pingable webcam that can be setup up anywhere with cell signal to record and send live video to any registered cell phone or email address. This project's inital intent is to allow for a live surf conditions check in remote locations but its potential applications are far less trivial and  nearly limitless.
